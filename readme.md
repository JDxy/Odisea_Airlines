# README ODISEA_AIRLINES

Odisea airlines is a web page about an airline that offers flights to different parts of the world to its customers.

## Installation

To be able to use the web previously you need to have php and xammp installed as well as a code editor. After having all the above installed we will have to go to xampp and activate sql and apache, then in the main Odyssey airlines folder we will go to the file "installer.php" and we will execute it in the terminal with "./installer.php" and now we will only have to go to the index of the project that is in the main folder and start it;
